This project involves the implementation of both Decimation-in-Time (DIT) and Decimation-in-Frequency (DIF) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms using Verilog. To ensure robust testing, layered testbenches were developed in SystemVerilog. The project also explores optimization strategies by comparing standard implementations with systolic architectures.

Key Features<br>
Verilog Implementation: Efficient realization of DIT and DIF FFT algorithms.<br>
SystemVerilog Testbenches: Comprehensive layered testbenches to validate functionality and performance. <br>
Optimization Analysis: Comparison of synthesis reports, including LUT counts. <br>
Evaluation of systolic versus non-systolic architectures for hardware efficiency. <br>
Outcomes <br>
A clear demonstration of the advantages and trade-offs in adopting systolic architectures for FFT processing.
